## How should I start learning Python?/ Python Learning Roadmap
Learning Python is easy but same time there is chance of missing the proper learning track. So, to learn Python programming or Programming with Python, you must follow a proper tutorial.You can learn Python using below syllabus/Python Course Content.

1. Python Fundamentals:
- Introduction to Python:Cover the basics of Python syntax, data types (strings, integers, lists, dictionaries), variables, operators, and control flow statements (if/else, for loops, while loops).
- Functions and Modules: Explain how to define and use functions for code reusability, explore built-in modules (like os, sys, json) and introduce package management with pip.
- Command Line Interface (CLI) Scripting:write Python scripts that interact with the operating system using the os module, automate tasks like file manipulation, process execution, and environment variable management.
- Version Control with Git: Integrate Git version control basics into the course, demonstrating how to manage Python scripts and DevOps configurations using Git commands.
- Configuration Management with Python: Introduce tools like Ansible or SaltStack that leverage Python for infrastructure and application configuration management.
